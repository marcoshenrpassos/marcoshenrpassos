### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on front-End. My Masters Project was to build a social network application that deals with crime related activities in a given area/city. I cannot show this project yet as I'm wating for my results from Uni. I built several modules and particularly contributed to the front-end, and a little to the back-end. Our client, supervisor and coordinator really appreciated our final product.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, but also getting better at HTML and CSS.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects, as I've decided to focus on this part of IT. I really enjoyed seeing my work shown on the screen. 

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting better at front-end.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am unable to find a fun fact that is not embarrasing...🤷‍♂️
